This repository contains (anonymized) test websites used in 
the experiments described in the USENIX Security 2026 
submission titled "Agentic Browsers and the Same-Origin Policy".

These websites must be hosted on two separate domains for 
testing. In this repository, we hace replaced the domains 
with anonymized placeholders A.com and B.com -- these must 
be replaced with real domains hosting the websites for them
to function correctly.

The prompts used to test agentic browsers on these websites
are included in full in Section 3 of the paper.
